			<h3>Character 1</h3>
			<p>One day the owner of Cafe Cinnamon looked up to see a white puppy floating 
				in the sky like a fluffy cloud. His tail was plump and curled up just 
				like a cinnamon roll, so she named him Cinnamon. They have been living 
				together ever since that day. He was instantly popular with customers, 
				and soon became Cafe Cinnamon's official mascot. He is quite shy, but 
				very friendly, and sometimes takes a nap on customers' laps. He can fly 
				through the air by flapping his huge ears.</p>

			<h3>Character 2</h3>
			<p>This boy golden retriever is unmistakable in his trademark brown beret. He has a laidback demeanor and loves 
				the phrase 'let's go out!' as much as he dislikes the word 'stay!' He collects shoes for a hobby, and has a secret 
				stash that includes one of his owner-father's leather shoes, and one of his owner-mother's sandals. He loves milk, 
				anything soft, and his mama's cream caramel puddings. He has a talent for napping and doing 'pompompurin aerobics', 
				and can make friends with anyone. His dream is to get even bigger. The basket in the entrance hall of his 
				sister-owner's house is where he calls home.</p>
